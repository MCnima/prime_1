About
This prime detector is made based on the Algoritm.txt file that I added in prime_1 repository.
This is my first python project in University and I decided to share with you.

Using Guide
For using code you have to inter your number after main.py in terminal or console with space between like:
main.py <your number>  => main.py 13 => The output is 'Number is prime'
or like: main.py 10 => THe output is 'Number is NOT prime'



I hope this will be helpful for you and have a great day.
